  <h1>Web Standards</h1>
  <p>Writing a specification that builds on the Web Platform requires in-depth knowledge of its core technologies: <cite>HTML5</cite>, <cite>Web IDL</cite>, and <cite>ECMAScript</cite>. I can edit and review  specifications to make sure they will work well with the core Web Platform.  </p>
  <h1>Prototypes</h1>
  <p>Independent verification of a specification through prototyping can be a cost effective way of showing the technical completeness of a specification and demonstrating that a specification works as intended. I can prototype specifications in <cite>ECMAScript</cite>, <cite>Node.js</cite>, and <cite>Java</cite>. </p>
  <h1>Quality Assurance</h1>
  <p>Test suites are key to achieving interoperability in the standardization process. Knowing how much and what areas to test can improve the interoperability of products. I can design, code, or review test suites as well as produce high-quality implementation reports. </p>
